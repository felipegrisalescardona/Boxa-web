                    Picture a time in the not-so-distant future. A time where cryptocurrency trading and investment has
                    become more safe, more secure, and more profitable. Imagine being a new entrant into the space,
                    wanting to experience all that crypto trading has to offer while feeling confident in an ecosystem
                    that is intuitively built to help you get that 'once in your lifetime' investment opportunity. An
                    Ecosystem built for the people, promoting financial well being and a better future. We believe that
                    decentralization is the future and that crypto will bring a real utility to the world. With that in
                    mind we started Boxa, a decentralized project focusing on real life utility and a decentralized
                    future. This is the future my friends, this is BOXA.

                    ecosystem, under which Boxa Estate, Boxa Royalty Program and Boxa Investment Fund will operate. From
                    the beginning, our main goal was to create a cryptocurrency with real life utility where it not only
                    can be used as an investment asset but also provides every holder access to a variety of perks and
                    benefits.</p>

                    decentralized royalty program. BOXA token is a deflationary currency, and we want to make sure it

                    we were looking for answers this popped-up in our minds. What if there will be a token which can
                    give you access to tons of different benefits, a token which not only can be used as an investment
                    asset but something you can use every day. A utility token backed by assets and a strong community
                    With this goal in mind Boxa token was born.
